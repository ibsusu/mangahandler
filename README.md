# mangahandler

Create a machine translated manga site with some simple code. :)
I'm dumping the code here because I don't want to work on it anymore.  it can be improved and it works well right now.

This thing consists of a command line program called mangahandler and the server to run it on.  The things you'll need to run it are: 
1. a server with enough memory
2. a google vision and translate api key.

You can always just run the command line program yourself and pop out some translated manga.  The instructions for using the program are in the mangahandler subdirectory

Everything is also set up as a dockerfile.  that should explain pretty much everything you need to know about the dependencies and setup.
you may need to set up some directories for temporary file handling if you use the server.
